## Classification Metrics and Thresholds

### Key Classification Features

1. **Customer Cone Size**
   - **Definition**: AS + all downstream customers (recursive)
   - **Large Providers**: >1000 ASNs in cone
   - **Medium Providers**: 100-1000 ASNs in cone  
   - **Small/End Users**: <100 ASNs in cone
   - **Data Source**: CAIDA AS Rank

2. **AS Degree Ratios**
   - **Provider/Customer Ratio**: Higher ratio indicates provider role
   - **Peer Count**: More peers suggest larger networks
   - **Transit vs. Peering**: Transit-heavy = service provider

3. **Prefix Count and Distribution**
   - **Large Cloud Providers**: 50-500+ IPv4 prefixes
   - **Hosting Companies**: 10-100 prefixes typically
   - **End Customers**: 1-10 prefixes usually
   - **CDNs**: Distributed smaller prefixes globally

4. **Traffic Engineering Indicators**
   - **BGP Path Length**: Shorter paths for major providers
   - **Route Specificity**: /24 announcements common in hosting
   - **Anycast Patterns**: Multiple locations announcing same prefix (CDN indicator)

## Implementation Strategy for Free Sources

### Recommended Data Collection Pipeline

1. **Primary Classification (BGPView API)**
   ```python
   # Conservative rate limiting: 3 requests/minute
   def get_asn_classification(asn):
       asn_details = bgpview_api.get_asn_details(asn)
       prefixes = bgpview_api.get_asn_prefixes(asn) 
       return classify_from_bgp_data(asn_details, prefixes)
   ```

2. **Enrichment (Hurricane Electric)**
   ```python
   # Web scraping for additional context
   def enrich_classification(asn, initial_classification):
       he_data = hurricane_electric.get_asn_details(asn)
       peers = he_data.get('peers', [])
       return refine_classification(initial_classification, peers)
   ```

3. **Validation (PeeringDB)**
   ```python
   # Cross-reference with industry database
   def validate_classification(asn, classification):
       peeringdb_data = peeringdb_api.get_network(asn)
       return cross_validate(classification, peeringdb_data)
   ```

### Multi-Source Confidence Scoring

```python
def calculate_confidence_score(classifications):
    """
    Combine classifications from multiple sources
    Weight by source reliability and agreement
    """
    weights = {
        'bgpview': 0.3,
        'hurricane_electric': 0.3, 
        'peeringdb': 0.25,
        'caida': 0.15
    }
    
    agreement_bonus = calculate_inter_source_agreement(classifications)
    return weighted_average(classifications, weights) + agreement_bonus
```

   - **Mitigation**: PeeringDB facility data helps

2. **Multi-Service Providers**
   - ISPs offering hosting services
   - Cloud providers with ISP services
   - **Challenge**: Hybrid business models

## Recommendations for Implementation

### 1. Tiered Classification Approach

1. **Tier 1: High-Confidence Rules** (>90% accuracy)
   - Known ASN patterns
   - Extreme customer cone sizes
   - Clear naming conventions

2. **Tier 2: Multi-Source Validation** (80-90% accuracy)
   - Combine 2-3 data sources
   - Statistical thresholds
   - Cross-validation checks

3. **Tier 3: Machine Learning** (75-85% accuracy)
   - Feature-based classification
   - Training on validated datasets
   - Continuous model updates

### 2. Rate Limiting Strategy

```python
RATE_LIMITS = {
    'bgpview': {'requests': 3, 'window': 60},     # Very conservative
    'hurricane_electric': {'requests': 6, 'window': 60},  # Respectful scraping
    'ripe_ris': {'requests': 30, 'window': 60},   # More permissive
    'peeringdb': {'requests': 60, 'window': 60}    # Industry database
}
```

### 3. Caching Strategy

- **ASN Details**: Cache for 24-48 hours
- **Relationship Data**: Cache for 7 days  
- **Classification Results**: Cache for 30 days with confidence decay

### 4. Fallback Mechanisms

1. **API Rate Limiting**: Fall back to cached data
2. **Service Unavailable**: Use alternative data sources
3. **Classification Uncertainty**: Return confidence scores with results

## Conclusion

Free BGP-based AS classification can achieve **75-95% accuracy** depending on the granularity and provider type. The key to maximizing accuracy is:

1. **Multi-source validation** using 2-3 independent data sources
2. **Conservative rate limiting** to maintain API access
3. **Tiered confidence scoring** based on data agreement
4. **Regular model updates** to handle changing business relationships

The most reliable classifications are for major cloud providers and CDNs (>90% accuracy), while distinguishing between small ISPs and hosting providers remains challenging (60-75% accuracy). Investment in data source diversity and validation logic significantly improves overall system accuracy.
