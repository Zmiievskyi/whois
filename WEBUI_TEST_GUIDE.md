cd /Users/anton/code-dev/provider_discovery

# Activate virtual environment
source venv_whois/bin/activate

# Start Streamlit
streamlit run app.py
```

### Test Scenarios:

#### 1. Basic Domain Analysis
- Enter: `github.com`
- Expected: Enhanced confidence higher than original
- Check: Active integrations 4-6/6
- Look for: Enhanced Analysis section

#### 2. SSL Analysis Verification
- Test domain with good SSL: `google.com`
- Check Enhanced Analysis ‚Üí SSL Certificate Analysis
- Expected: Grade A or A+, security score 80+

#### 3. Geographic Intelligence
- Test: `8.8.8.8` or `1.1.1.1`
- Check Enhanced Analysis ‚Üí Geographic Intelligence
- Expected: Location with high confidence

#### 4. BGP Analysis
- Test: Any major site
- Check Enhanced Analysis ‚Üí BGP Routing Analysis
- Expected: ASN information, possibly peers data

#### 5. Threat Intelligence
- Test: `github.com` (should be low threat)
- Check Enhanced Analysis ‚Üí Threat Intelligence
- Expected: Low threat level, good reputation

#### 6. Cross-Validation
- Test: Well-known sites
- Check Enhanced Analysis ‚Üí Cross-Validation
- Expected: Multiple sources confirming providers

### Expected Improvements:

1. **Higher Confidence Scores**: Enhanced confidence should be 10-30% higher than original
2. **More Provider Details**: Additional providers detected via new integrations
3. **Security Insights**: SSL grades, threat levels, security recommendations
4. **Geographic Data**: Location information with confidence scores
5. **BGP Intelligence**: ASN data, routing information
6. **Real-time Status**: Integration health visible in sidebar

### Troubleshooting:

#### If Enhanced Detector Not Available:
- Check imports in app.py
- Verify Enhanced Provider Detector is properly installed
- System will fallback to original detector

#### If Some Integrations Failed:
- Check sidebar for integration status
- 4/6 integrations is acceptable for full functionality
- Network connectivity issues may affect some integrations

#### Performance Issues:
- First load may be slower due to integration initialization
- Subsequent requests use caching for better performance
- Rate limiting built-in for respectful API usage

### Browser Access:
- Open: http://localhost:8501
- The interface should show "Enhanced Provider Discovery Tool v3.0"
- System health metrics should be visible at the top

## Compatibility:

- **Backward Compatible**: Works with original detector if Enhanced not available
- **Graceful Degradation**: Displays available data even if some integrations fail
- **Error Handling**: Shows integration status and error information

The WebUI now provides a comprehensive interface for the Enhanced Provider Detection System with all 6 FREE integrations fully supported!
